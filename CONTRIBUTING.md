### Missing a feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a
proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **major feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
  that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our
  efforts, prevent duplication of work and help you to craft the change so
  that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* **Small features and bugs** can be crafted and directly submitted as a pull
  request (PR). However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it
  into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the
  overall functionality of this project.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. Maybe the problem
you are encountering is already known and the discussion might inform you of
workarounds readily available.

We want to address all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug
we first need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will
systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the
custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal
reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue.

### Submitting a pull request

Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You
don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR,
go ahead.

1. Fork the project, make your changes in a separate git branch and add
   descriptive messages to your commits.

2. Push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to
  `terraform-aws-cognito-auth:master`. If we suggest changes, rebase your
   branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will
   automatically update your PR.

After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository.
